# Interval-Scheduling

## Introduction
Interval Scheduling is an optimization problem-solving method commonly used for resource scheduling or task scheduling.

## Description
Interval Scheduling is Greedy algorithm that selects as many tasks as possible without generating conflicts, given a series of tasks and their time intervals. Each task has a start and end time, and there may be conflicts or overlapping times between tasks.
